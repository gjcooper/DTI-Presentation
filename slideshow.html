Diffusion Weighted Imaging sequences are a process where by acquiring many different images with different gradients we can get a measure of the amount of diffusivity across the brain. We can then fit a tensor (diffusion ellipsoid) that sums up all the information from each gradient at each voxel.

### Sequences

Varying sequence components for diffusion can consist of:

* the number of directions

* whether a reverse phase encoded sequence is run

* the number of b0 measurements/repeat measurements

* whether the sequence was multi-shell

A good heuristic is to acquire opposite phase encoded directions to help correct for eddy currents, distortions.

At least 40 directions should be acquired for b-values over 1000. Then time constraints/patient comfort and other factors will determine the number of directions, repeated measures and other factors.

A sample sequence might look something like: 1 P&gtA b0 as a separate sequence, and then a second sequence with A&gtP2 sets of b3000 measurements interspersed with b0 measurements.emphatic[*]

.footnote[.emphatic[*] This would give multiple measures at each gradient direction to help correct for any movement, and an opposite direction to correct for eddy current distortions]

Certain things to look out for when acquiring data:

* Eddy current distortions

* Movement can have a particularly large impact

* Other traditional MR artifact sources also affect quality.

## Pre-processing Steps
### Conversion
]
.right-column[
First step after receiving the DICOM files from the scanner is to convert them to a format that is recognised by the software you intend to use for the rest of your analysis steps. 

There are many conversion tools out there. A lot of analysis packages contain a conversion tool, or you can use a standalone tool.

The most widely used format, particularly for open source or freely available software is the nifti file format. The freely available `dcm2niix` package is one popular choice for conversion.

### Movement/Distortion correction
]
.right-column[
Most analysis toolchains for diffusion data will have some method for correcting for subject movement and eddy current distortions, and perhaps susceptibility distortions as well.

NOTE: In some instances it may be necessary to manually rotate the original bvecs (gradient vector information) after distortion/motion correction.

With FSL current versions recommend a combination of the `eddy` and `topup` tools.

### Diffusion Tensor Fitting

.right-column[
This is another steps that most of the analysis packages have an implementation of. It is this step that generates Fractional Anisotropy maps, Mean Diffusivity maps and more.

FSL has a processing step called `dtifit` that takes the eddy current corrected data, a whole brain mask, usually generated with it's brain extraction tool `bet` which strips the skull and external data from a b0 image, and then outputs a range of files, including those mentioned above.

There are mulitple ways to generate masks used for tractography, including:

* Use masks from a predefined/default atlas. Fast. Lacks precision.

* Use masks from a structural analysis of our participants (Freesurfer or similar)

* Use masks from another group that have scanned regions of interest in higher field strengths, ie 7T

# Final Thoughts
1. Normalisation for comparing between subjects
2. Thresholding for throwing away values with low probability of being on tract.
