# Background 

Diffusion Weighted Imaging sequences are a process where by acquiring many different images with different gradients we can get a measure of the amount of diffusivity across the brain. We can then fit a tensor (diffusion ellipsoid) that sums up all the information from each gradient at each voxel.

---

## Sequences

Varying sequence components for diffusion can consist of:
- the number of directions
- whether a reverse phase encoded sequence is run
- the number of b0 measurements/repeat measurements
- whether the sequence was multi-shell

---

## Sequence setup

A good heuristic is to acquire opposite phase encoded directions to help correct for eddy currents, distortions. At least 40 directions Should be acquired for b values over 1000. Then time constraints/patient comfort and other factors will determine the number of directions, repeated measures and other factors.

---

## Sources of Noise

Certain things to look out for when acquiring data:
* Eddy current distortions
* Movement is particularly impactful
* Other traditional MR artifact sources also affect quality.

# Generating Masks

* Use masks from a predefined/default atlas. Fast. Lacks precision.
* Use masks from a structural analysis of our participants (Freesurfer or similar)
* Use masks from another group that have scanned regions of interest in higher field strengths, ie 7T

# Final Thoughts

1. Normalisation for comparing between subjects
2. Thresholding for throwing away values with low probability of being on tract.
