# Diffusion Weighted Imaging Analysis

  ### Background
]

.right-column[
  Diffusion Weighted Imaging sequences are a process where by acquiring many different images with different gradients we can get a measure of the amount of diffusivity across the brain. We can then fit a tensor (diffusion ellipsoid) that sums up all the information from each gradient at each voxel.

.right_column[
  Varying sequence components for diffusion can consist of:
  * the number of directions
  * whether a reverse phase encoded sequence is run
  * the number of b0 measurements/repeat measurements
  * whether the sequence was multi-shell

.right-column[
  A good heuristic is to acquire opposite phase encoded directions to help correct for eddy currents, distortions.
  
  At least 40 directions should be acquired for b values over 1000. Then time constraints/patient comfort and other factors will determine the number of directions, repeated measures and other factors.

  A sample sequence might look something like: 1 P&gtA b0 as a separate sequence, and then a second sequence with A&gtP2 sets of b3000 measurements interspersed with b0 measurements.red[*]

  .footnote[.red[*] This would give multiple measures at each gradient direction to help correct for any movement, and an opposite direction to correct for eddy current distortions]

  Certain things to look out for when acquiring data:

  * Eddy current distortions

  * Movement is particularly impactful

  * Other traditional MR artifact sources also affect quality.

# Generating Masks

* Use masks from a predefined/default atlas. Fast. Lacks precision.
* Use masks from a structural analysis of our participants (Freesurfer or similar)
* Use masks from another group that have scanned regions of interest in higher field strengths, ie 7T

---

# Final Thoughts

1. Normalisation for comparing between subjects
2. Thresholding for throwing away values with low probability of being on tract.
